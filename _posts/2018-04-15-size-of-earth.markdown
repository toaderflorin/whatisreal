title:  "How Did Eratosthenes Figure Out The Size Of The Earth?"
description: "Apparently people knew the Earth was round for quite some time because not only are the other heavenly bodies like the Moon and Sun round, but it turns out you can actually see the Earth's shadow projected on the Moon during a partial Moon eclipse - so naturally it had to have a certain size, which at least in principle could have been determined.

Apparently people knew the Earth was round for quite some time because not only are the other heavenly bodies like the Moon and Sun round, but it turns out you can actually see the Earth's shadow projected on the Moon during a partial Moon eclipse -- so naturally it had to have a certain size, which at least in principle could have been determined (and this was first done by none other than Eratosthenes of *the sieve of Eratosthenes* fame).

Legend has it there was a very deep well in Syene (ancient Egypt) in which the sun shone all the way to the bottom during summer solstice. This is not something that's normal, in fact it's a very rare occurrence: in most places on Earth the sun is never at the zenith, it's usually at an angle which depends on the time of the year. A year long exposure photograph (taken with a pinhole camera) that captures its daily path in the sky looks like:

The sun is at its highest during summer solstice at noon.

Eratosthenes wanted to measure exactly how different the orientation of the Sun is in the sky during solstice some place north of Syene, and he choose the city of Alexandria. He did this using a simple technique: sticking a rod perpendicular in the Earth and comparing the size of its shadow to the size of the rod itself. He figured that the incident angle of sunlight was about 1 / 50 of a circle, or 7.2 degrees.

Assuming the Sun is at a distance much greater than the size of the Earth and approximating that the light rays arrive parallel in Alexandria and Syene, this means that the distance between the cities is 1 / 50 of the diameter of the Earth. This distance is approximately 800 km, which multiplied by 50 gives us a circumference of 40,000 km, which is very close to the 40,075km circumference of the Earth around the equator. Simple and accurate!
