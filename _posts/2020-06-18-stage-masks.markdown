*And men and women merely players.* Everybody wears masks. Which means when you meet people or when you check their social media profile, you meet their *persona*, which is their PR department essentially. You don't get to meet the real them, at least not initially. 

There will usually be some telltale signs that slip through the cracks, however, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

You might have experienced some of the following:
* Have you ever been to an interview, and you thought you did outstanding, only to find out they've "decided to move on to someone else who is a better fit for the role"? On the flip side, did you do terribly and then was surprised you got the job?
* Have you ever been on a date with a girl that was crazy about you, you felt the date went great, in fact she liked you so much that she was nervous, and then she stopped responding to your messages? 
* Have you ever met a girl that's was nice and polite, you thought she liked you, you asked her out, only for her to reject you?
* You might have been surprised to find that Mark Zuckerberg drives a Volkswagen Golf, or that Ingvar Kamprad (the founder of Ikea) was riding to work on the subway everyday.

It doesn't seem to make much sense on the surface level, but on closer inspection, it absolutely does. We simply need to dig a little bit deeper, and as usual, evolutionary biology provides the answer.

Have you ever wondered how a species of relatively weak individuals like homo sapiens took over the world? Several reasons: big brains, vocal cords that allow complex communication, and opposable thumbs. Let's consider an interesting scenario. A bigger, stronger male might assume the role of the leader of a tribe, but of course, that position is quite precarious because, at any time, several other males could form a coalition and kill him. Or a lone individual could assassinate him secretly, without other individuals from the tribe being there to see it. So a leader of the tribe would have to walk an extremely fine line between being tough and being empathetic. 

*And of course higher status males would reproduce more so that's why, evolution selected for social intelligence moreso than it did for physical strength.* 

In general, confident high status people attempt to lower their perceived status to make themselves more approachable. Mark Zuckerberg or course drives a Golf to work and in public (because that's when people see him, so that's his PR interface), but he lives in a multi milion dollar mansion in a gated community, that the public doesn't get to see. They do this because they don't

Insecure people also play the social game, but they try to compensate in the other direction. If they perceive somebody as a threat to their social status, they will:
* Try to act arrogant to subtly indimitate the other person.
* Attempt to subtly put down, or *gaslight*, the other person.
* Try extremely hard to look cool.
* Gang up and exclude that person from the group, in a social setting, like dance or sport classes.
* You guessed it, reject a CV if they think the applicant is a threat to them. It's worth pointing out that an interviewer might also reject a candidate if they think he or she is overqualified and won't stick around for long.
  
It's worth mentioning that status is relative.

Female competition is also interesting, but the general theme here is looks versus competence.

 You'll be surprised that no matter how nice this girl is, she's going to have difficulty making friends.
