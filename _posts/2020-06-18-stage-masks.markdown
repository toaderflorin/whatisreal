*And men and women merely players.* Everybody wears masks. Which means when you meet people or when you check their social media profile, you meet their *persona*, which is their PR department essentially. You don't get to meet the real them, at least not initially. There will usually be some telltale signs that slip through the cracks, however, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

A lot of human behavior doesn't seem to make much sense. For example, a girl that's crazy about you might act like she hates you, and a girl that isn't particularly attracted to you might act very nice, but reject you if you ask her out.

It doesn't seem to make much sense on the surface level, but on closer inspection, it absolutely does. We simply need to dig a little bit deeper, and as usual, evolutionary biology provides the answer.

Have you ever wondered how a species of relatively weak individuals like homo sapiens took over the world? Several reasons: big brains, vocal cords that allow for complex communication, and opposable thumbs. Let's consider an interesting scenario. A bigger, stronger male might assume the role of the leader of a tribe, but of course, that position is quite precarious because, at any time, several other males could form a coalition and kill him, thus removing him from the alpha position. Or a lone individual could assassinate him secretly, without other individuals from the tribe being there to see it -- so the leader would have to walk an extremely fine line between being tough and being empathetic. Social inteligence would be more important than physical strength. And of course, higher status males would reproduce more, so that's why evolution selected for social intelligence more than it did for physical strength.

*People usually don't say what they mean and they don't mean what they say.*


In general, confident high status people attempt to lower their perceived status to make themselves more approachable. Mark Zuckerberg or course drives a Golf to work and in public (because that's when people see him, so that's his PR interface), but he lives in a multi milion dollar mansion in a gated community, that the public doesn't get to see. They do this because: 

* They don't necessarily need to impress people that they feel are below them in terms of social status.
* Other people might compare themselves to them and become resentful. There's nothing for them to gain from that.

So what you're seeing is a mask. But there are cracks in the mask because these people still feel the need to impress other people which they deem high status.

What you're seeing here is a bit of an oddity: a conservative looking watch that doesn't look like anything special, yet it costs 200 thousands dollars.

Of course, looks can be extremely deceiving because the watch is a masterpiece of mechanical design. Just by turning it around, you get to see the beautifully decorated back and the complicated and intricately designed mechanism. It is the pinacle of stealth wealth.

Insecure people also play the social game, but they try to compensate in the other direction. If they perceive somebody as a threat to their social status, they will:

* Act in an arrogant manner.
* Attempt to put down subtly, or *gaslight*, other people.
* Try extremely hard to look cool.
* You guessed it, reject a CV if they think the applicant is a threat to them. It's worth pointing out that an interviewer might also reject a candidate if they believe the candidate is overqualified and won't stick around for long.
  
You are again seeing a mask, but this time it serves a different purpose. The purpose is to hide that person's insecurities OR to lower your sense of self-worth, which gives them a competitive advantage over you.

*Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.*

It seems like nature has engrained Sun Tzuâ€™s advice in our intuitive/instinctive behavior.

*Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.*
