If you follow math [channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww) on the internet, you may have heard that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... is no longer infinity but now equals -1/12 and you may even wonder how this strange turn of events came to be, because it's not what your elementary math school teacher thought you.

The short story is numbers are just symbols you write on a piece of paper and you can come up with whatever rules you want to add them up. The longer explanation is in mathematics, you want to study if analytical series that don't converge have some deeper meaning so you *invent* a rule to ascribe meaning to that sum. In some cases this is handy, in other cases it leads to mathematical curiosities.

In 1960, Eugene Wigner put out a paper called *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences*, to which I would. Well, what is mathematics? It's a system. We've invented it to match observation. People needed to count sheep. Rulers needed to keep track of how big their armies were. So we developed systems. And to the extent these systems are used for something they work. Sophus Lee invented continuous symmetry groups to capture certain aspects of what he was studying. You get where I'm going with this.

Mathematics works because we created it to model a certain domain or class of objects.

Think about the number we call pi. By definition, it is the ratio of the diameter of a perfect circle to its radius. Now I have a few questions:

1. Can you draw a "perfect" circle?
2. What exactly is "length"?

Surely one can define these concepts using some axioms. For example we can use Pythagoras's theorem to define distances which means the distance is the square of. OK, but then what is a right angle?

So we define pi as being the ratio using this newly minted definition of length. That is fine, but you still can't write down the number in digits completely.

There is another number we call e. If you put them together, you get a relation that Feynman called the most beautiful relation in mathematics.

If you look at the mathematics used in physics let's say in quantum field theory, they break down once you've go past a scale, so physicists need to patch them up -- they use regularization techniques similar to the

There is an underlying recurrent theme here: the stuff that we see
