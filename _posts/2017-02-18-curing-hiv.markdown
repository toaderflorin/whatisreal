There is an urban myth going around that HIV was created in the lab by the CIA as part of some "black ops" type of program and that the United States government has a cure for it, and while it's fun to speculate if one gets into the specifics of the virus, it's easy to dispel this myth. Genetic sequencing of the virus seems to point to the fact that HIV is descendant from the SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) virus and that the first transmission of SIV to HIV in humans took place around 1920 in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (yes, the virus crossed over from primates, but interestingly enough, most primate species seem to be unaffected by the virus).

The initial AIDS epidemic started in the late ’70s, but it wasn’t recognized as a new disease back then. After an outbreak of various illnesses that were previously very rare like *Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia* or *Kaposi’s Sarcoma* among gay men, it was suspected that the culprit might be a yet undiscovered pathogen that affects the immune system. In 1981 alone there were 270 reported cases of this severe immunodeficiency among gay communities, so it was called *gay-related immune deficiency* or GRID for short.

However, after an explosion of cases among hemophiliacs, it soon became clear that anybody was susceptible to become infected and the name was changed to *acquired immune deficiency syndrome*, or AIDS for short.

To understand why it’s so hard to cure AIDS, we need to explain its mechanism of action, how the immune system works, and how the AIDS virus in particular is different from other viruses. The first thing that one needs to know about viruses is that whereas bacteria are fully-fledged microorganisms that can replicate themselves (they have ribosomes and can perform protein synthesis on their own), viruses are essentially just proteic capsules which contain genetic material — DNA or RNA, depending on the virus. So to replicate themselves, viruses need to attach to a host cell, inject their genetic material inside that cell and rely on the protein synthesis mechanism of the cell to create copies of themselves. During cell division, the virions are ejected and released into the bloodstream where they attach to and infect other cells.

The HIV virus looks something like the picture from the start of the article and it binds to the CD4 protein on the membrane of the T helper cells (also called CD4+ T cells). T helper cells are our body’s defense system — they fight off infection.

The reason why HIV destroys T cells was long a mystery. But according to new research, it’s because when T cells get infected, they release chemical inflammation triggers in the bloodstream which attract other T cells through a process called chemotaxis (chemical attraction). This is a normal process used by the immune system to fight infectious agents, but in the case of HIV it creates a vicious circle: the GD4+T cells gang up on HIV infected cells and kill them, and as a result they can also get infected. In time, the T cells get more and more depleted and the infected individual is susceptible to all sorts of infectious diseases that normally would not be deadly.

So why it’s so hard to cure HIV? There are two reasons:

1. It’s an RNA virus, which means its molecule is a lot more unstable chemically than that of a DNA virus because it only has one strand.
2. Natural virus reservoirs in the body.

DNA is made out of two RNA strands. The nitrogenous bases G, U, A and C that make up the DNA and encode the genetic information are complementary (G attracts U and A attracts C), forming a more rigid structure than you have with RNA. It’s more stable for the same reason why a stool with four legs is more stable than a stool with two legs, in case you are wondering. With DNA, genetic information is duplicated so it’s a lot harder to get data corruption (mutations).

Number 1 is also the reason we have a Hepatitis B vaccine (it’s a DNA virus), and we don’t have a Hepatitis C vaccine (which is RNA). The virus is simply able to outsmart your typical vaccine.

CD4+T cells are programmed to fight against specific pathogens by being exposed to molecules called antigens, which trigger a differentiation process in these cells. They go from naïve T cells to specialized ones. A vaccine works by exposing the body to dead or weakened pathogens that cannot infect but can still trigger an immune response because they have the respective antigens on the cell membrane (or the virus envelope, in the case of a virus). RNA viruses are sneaky — even the body becomes immune to a certain version of the virus, the virus population can quickly mutate to become undetectable. The old versions of the virus simply die, and the undetectable ones survive. This presents significant challenges for developing a vaccine for HIV.

And as you can guess, it’s highly effective — a patient on HAART will have essentially undetectable HIV levels in his/her bloodstream (btw, this is why Charlie Sheen’s doctor was willing to have unprotected sex with him, in case you are wondering), but the question is: why isn’t this approach able to eradicate the virus from the body? The simple answer is HIV can be easily eradicated as long as cells divide. The problem is the virus can find it’s way into the nucleus of cells that don’t divide very often, like bones, the lining of the stomach, etc. The brain is also a formidable [HIV reservoir](https://www.poz.com/article/brain-reservoir-23545-5827).

What’s also interesting is that when some cells detect changes in their DNA (which to the cell signals potential cancer), the cell division is inhibited to prevent a tumor from forming. Because these cells have a very low replication rate, the virus can hide inside these cells indefinitely. So while it’s easy to get HIV counts down to detectable levels, a functional cure has proven elusive.

Hopefully we'll see real progress here soon, but the good news for those infected is that they can live fairly normal lives with the current treatments available.
