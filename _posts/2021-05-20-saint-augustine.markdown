title:  "Saint Augustine's Opinion On Time Is Irrelevant"
description: "Not that long ago, Lawrence Krauss appeared on Rogan's podcast and we got this as a result. Eric Weinstein decided this explanation wasn't good or intuitive enough, so he thought of explaining gauge symmetry in terms of fiber bundles and he brought up a Hopf fibration to exemplify. To people struggling to understand the concept, I doubt it's much help.

*"Now Besso has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."* said Einstein in 1955. He died a few months after... And it's hard to know what meaning to attribute to those words -- did he mean to say that the future already exists, or perhaps there is no absolute meaning to the present moment, or that there is no distinction between past, present and future?

Philosophy has no shortage of discussions about time. Newton thought space and time are absolute. Leibniz strongly disagreed and concluded that space and time are most likely some kind of network of relationships.

Yet there is one guy that for some particular reason comes up a lot more in philosophical discussions and that's Saint Augustine. In the *Confessions*, Augustine elaborates on time.

1. The past is no longer, it was.
2. The future is not yet, but it will be.
3. The present is, but cannot last because if the present would last, then it would be eternity and not the
present.
4. The presentâ€™s being as time depends on its perpetual flowing or passing away.
5. Thus, the being of time depends on its non-being.

*I don't know about you, but this isn't saying much.*

In fact, everything we know about space and time post Einstein seems to contradict this and probably Einstein himself didn't fully understand the extent of the philosophical implications of his theory until some time later. It was Lorentz who came up with the formulas for going from one frame of reference to another, but it was Hermann Minkowski who came up with the concept of [spacetime]().

*You can measure time in meters if you want, but I'm getting slightly ahead of myself.*

I want you to have a look at something. You really need to see an autopsy to see just how big the human brain is -- and it uses up a lot of glucose to operate.

The brain is incredibly efficient at some things (like processing visual expressions of other humans) and really bad at doing basic calculations like taking the square root out of 251. A computer would be the exact opposite. This, by the way, is why you have a hard time understanding quantum mechanics.

Most of us are familiar with Pythagora's theorem from highschool.

We understand how space works. Imagine you have a stick -- if you know where the ends are in some coordinate system, you can calculate the length by summing up the square.

We use this grid model and assign coordinates to points which depend on how we choose this coordinate system. But this is arbitrary.

No matter how we rotate the stick or we change the coordinate system, the length stays the same. We learned that in high-school. Minkowski realised that while space depends on observer movement, there is another quantity that is invariant.

The problem is that if you take Lorentz transforms into account, this no longer holds. But if you can't rely on the Euclidean distance, what can you rely on? Minkowski figured it's this.
