title:  "Harmony"
description: "When most people learn to play guitar, they usually start by learning a few chords, a beat, and then try to put together a rhythmic foundation for a song. Me being me on the other hand, and because I've been a fan of Hendrix and SRV since as far as I can remember and wanted to play like them (I'm also lazy), thought it would be a good idea (it's a terrible idea) to skip ahead and directly try to play lead and solos, which meant I had to learn the scales--you know, the thing that every classical music student dreads."

When most people learn to play guitar, they usually start by learning a few chords, a beat, and then try to put together a rhythmic foundation for a song. Me being me on the other hand, and because I've been a fan of Hendrix and SRV since as far as I can remember and wanted to play like them (I'm also lazy), thought it would be a good idea (it's a terrible idea) to skip ahead and directly try to play lead and solos, which meant I had to learn the scales--you know, the thing that every classical music student dreads.

It wasn't <i>that</i> bad, but not knowing any music theory, a thing that struck me as being very odd was the way these scales look on the guitar neck: <i>why is the distance between all notes two semitones, except for the second and third note in a minor scale and also the sixth and the seventh?</i> You can also see it on the piano: there aren't any black keys between B / C and E / F.

But first, what exactly is a “note”?

Let's start with the basics: sound is just a vibration of air that hits our ear. Similarly, when you throw a pebble in a pond, you get ripples across the surface of the water—that’s kind of what sound is but in three dimensions. And when sound hits a wall, it reverberates—it bounces back just like waves hitting the edge of a pool (that’s echo). So when you pluck a guitar string, the waves travel out until they hit the edge of the string and then bounce back. An important thing to mention here is that when they reflect, they do so in counter phase and this causes a significant portion of the sound to cancel out--the only parts of the wave that “survive” and provide a sizable contribution to the sound are the ones that have a wavelength that fits exactly inside the length of the string.

A standing wave looks like this:

So you don’t hear just one frequency, you hear more—these are called harmonics. When you play an A4 note on the piano, you don’t just hear a 440Hz sound, you also hear a fainter 880Hz, an even fainter 1320Hz, etc.

When playing two notes at the same time, the more harmonics they share, the more consonant they sound. And the simpler the ratio of the base frequencies, the more harmonics are shared. And what’s the simplest ratio possible? It’s 2/1. This is the most fundamental interval in music, the octave.

Here's an example: A4 decomposed yields 440Hz, 880Hz, 1320Hz, 1760Hz, etc. A5 yields 880Hz, 1760Hz, etc. As you can see, A4 fully contains A5 in its harmonic composition and they are so consonant, that they have been given the same name—A (or La)! Another simple ratio is 3/2, an interval which is called a perfect fifth. A chord containing the root node and the fifth is called a *power chord* and it's considered the staple of rock music. This relationship also yields the [circle of fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths).

We can also think of other ratios like 4/3—this is called the perfect fourth, or 5/4 which is a major third, etc. 

The relationship between consonance and ratios was known as far back as antiquity. It was Ptolemy who came up with an interesting system of tuning for harps: start with one string of any length, doesn’t matter what length--this string gives you the [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)) for your instrument. Then continue adding strings, the condition being these additional strings have to have those simple ratios we mentioned in terms of length in relation to the base string. 

A typical harp would have the following strings:

1. Start with a string of any length. This is a C, the root note, or the key
2. The second string will be 9/8 times the length of the first. We now call this a D.
3. The third will be 5/4. This is now an E.
4. The fourth will be 4/3 of the first. An F.
5. The fifth will be 3/2 of the first. A G.
6. Sixth will be 5/3 of the first. An A.
7. The seventh will be 15/8. A B.
8. Eight will be 2/1. Again, a C, one octave higher.

Hmm, not a lot of notes. So maybe we can extend this harp. Let’s add another octave using the same ratios as before, but now using the last string as the new root node. And if we want another octave, we can do it again. And again. And so on... There are various problems with this approach such as the [wolf interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval), but I won’t get into them.

Fast forward to more modern times, when bands of musicians started to appear and we now have a major problem: all the instruments in a band or orchestra would have to be tuned in the same key, otherwise they would sound dissonant. It was Beethoven who is credited with solving the problem by coming up with a new tuning method -- his idea was to divide each octave into 12 equal sub-intervals called *semitones*. Each semitone is 1.059463094 greater in pitch than the previous, that’s 2 raised to the power 1/12. Because the semitones are equally spaced, we can transpose the same song up or down, so you can play a solo in A minor on the 5th fret on the guitar, or in E minor on the 12th for example, and it will sound the same -- just higher or lower in pitch.

So why the two holes on the piano keyboard, you ask? Turns out that the best approximation of Ptolemy’s scale using Beethoven’s system is to use 2–2–1–2–2–2–1 intervals, which means you will have two steps that are only one semitone in size (this is called a [diatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale)). And since the white keys on the keyboard correspond only to the notes of the C major scale (which has the [same notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_key) as A minor), and the black keys correspond to the rest, now you know there aren't any black ones between B/C and E/F.
