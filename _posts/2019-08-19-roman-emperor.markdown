Whether it's your wife coming home from the mall with yet another bag that she doesn't need, but she bought it *because it was on sale*, a coworker snapping at you because he had a bad day or a road rage incident that ended in legal repercussions, human behaviour shows no shortage of irrationality and I'm sure you've been left scratching your head on more than one occasion. Of course, this is understandable because a lot of the time people can't control their impulses in the spur of the moment, yet there are times when people intentionally make decisions that for an outside observer (that's not emotionally invested) look totally irrational -- they might get into a relationship with somebody that's really bad for them or they might take on a loan and pay an exorbitant amount of money on a new car in order to get social status points.

Or they might try to become emperor in ancient Rome.

In case you didn't know, Rome had a [year of the four emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors), a [year of the five emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Five_Emperors) and even a [year of the six Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Six_Emperors).

Since most likely they had history books in Rome, you would have to wonder why would anybody want this job after a hundred years or so, considering the track record. Of course your typical Roman emperor is not a typical person -- if you are to go by the accounts of historians like Cassius Dio or Suetionus, Caligula had sex with his sisters, wanted to make his horse a senator and even consecrated himself. Commodus, son of the great Marcus Aurelius (and the poster child for failed parenting strategies), fancied himself as a gladiator and competed in the Colosseum (obviously, he always won) killing numerous people and animals in the process. Nero thought he was a great harp player (and overall artist) and infamously executed people for the slightest offence -- like dousing off during his concerts. But even by these loosely defined standards of "normality", one would assume that they would have at least some sense of self preservation?

Here's what the chart looks like and the prospects are definitely not rosy.

![chart-roman-deaths](/images/death-roman.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

It's worth mentioning the fact that not in all cases an emperor would actually decide to take on the role of his own accord, they would either be proclaimed emperor by the Praetorian Guard to suit their agenda, they would inherit the position (an existing emperor would "adopt" them, as it was the case with Trajan) or they would be the legitimate biological heir to the throne. But there were several occasions where a powerful general would use force to become emperor, or a wealthy senator would pay the Praetorians an exorbitant amount of money after the previous emperor was assassinated in a plot (in which they most likely took part) in order to secure the position and take the defunct ruler's place. Which leads to the question *why do it?*

*Would't they assume they'd be next?*

But as baffling as that behaviour is, it turns out we can get the answer from biology -- the chimpanzee is one closest species in terms of shared DNA to ours and for a long time chimps were considered to be quite tame. The first blow to our understanding of chimp social dynamics came in 1974 when Jane Goodall was observing the population native to the Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania when members of a group organised an ambush and killed a member of a different group.

Needless to say, she was shocked because this was the first time she was observing the deliberate organised killing of a chimp by another group of chimps. Soon other raids would follow and they didn't stop until four years later, when the members of one of the tribes were all dead. Goodall would go on to write:

*For several years I struggled to come to terms with this new knowledge. Often when I woke in the night, horrific pictures sprang unbidden to my mind—Satan, cupping his hand below Sniff's chin to drink the blood that welled from a great wound on his face; old Rodolf, usually so benign, standing upright to hurl a four-pound rock at Godi's prostrate body; Jomeo tearing a strip of skin from Dé's thigh; Figan, charging and hitting, again and again, the stricken, quivering body of Goliath, one of his childhood heroes.*

This was of course the infamous Gombe war in which members of one group systematically hunted down and killed the others, while sustaining a lot of casualties of their own. But it's not only competing tribes that fight one another -- chimpanzees are notorious for forming alliances and taking down their own leader if the alpha male proves too domineering, as well as forming factions *inside* a tribe. Since we humans share 98% of the chimp DNA, we really are not that much different, so you definitely see this kind of behaviour in humans tribes. There's this romantic view that Native Americans were peace pipe smoking hippies, but a whopping third of their remains show signs of violent death, so they certainly were territorial and the tribes fought among themselves, but there probably was quite a bit of infighting as well -- also there is no reason to suspect that Homo Sapiens tribes in the stone age were different. It's clear that climbing the social ladder is not without risk. So why do it? Wouldn't it be better to just lay low? Turns out evolution and the [triune brain theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain) can give us a very good answer.

![triune](/images/triune.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

The brain isn't a perfectly designed and engineered piece of circuitry. It evolved *gradually*, so in a sense it's a like really old software that has been patched and repurposed over a long period of time. It's a mess! Remember that when you see behaviour that leaves you dumbfounded. The brain also has quite a bit of baggage -- a lot of our basic instincts are severely out of place in the modern world where they would have been otherwise useful in the past. Take for example our sweet tooth: while in the Siberian tundra, eating as much honey as one could get their hands on (and storing some fat reserves) was a good thing. Right now it just makes us obese and prone to diabetes and heart disease.

One also has to consider the fact that in most species, only the dominant male in the group will produce issue, so even if there is considerable risk associated with being the alpha male (you are suddenly a target), it was the only way for males to pass on their genes, hence the compulsion to fight for the top position. And even if a male would have been able to hold the top position only for a few years and be killed afterwards, he would still have been able to father dozens of children in this time -- which makes this strategy a no brainer from an evolutionary point of view. Of course, as a rich nobleman in ancient Rome one could have simply married, have a few kids and be done with it. That would seem like the rational course of action, but that's not how the brain works because evolutionary speaking simply not enough time had passed and the brain of a Roman citizen would have been the same as that of a cave dweller -- so the compulsion to climb the hierarchy no matter the cost would have been there. By the way, there is no difference between the typical brain of a Roman and ours, so I guess you know where I am going with this. We don't kill each other anymore, but there certainly is a competition in the boardroom, at the gym and so forth.

In fact, the majority of the things we do are emotional, we simply *backwards rationalise* them after the fact and of course marketers and politicians know this. By the way, if you were surprised that Donald Trump was able to win the United States general elections, here's Scott Adams [explaining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1eUSvxJSQ) to Rogan just how irrational our decision making process is. Enjoy.
