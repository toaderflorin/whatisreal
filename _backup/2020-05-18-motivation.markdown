I don't have a degree in physics. Admittedly, I did learn some more advanced mathematics, including some abstract algebra or operational calculus, but I didn't enjoy it all that much. Since I was interested in computers and computer science in general, I didn't see the point in learning about Banach spaces, for example. And I felt I was force-fed information that would not serve any practical purpose for my future goals.

It turns out that it was both correct and not so much because, while it only briefly helped me in my career, it came quite helpful when I was trying to understand some of the big philosophical questions of our time.

When you are going through a curriculum, you are usually asked to trust the system because you are being taught things that might (or might not) be useful in the future. It requires a leap of fate and surrendering yourself to the teacherâ€”a bit like the karate kid going alow with Master Miyagi's car waxing approach.

Let's start with a definition from Wikipedia:

*In mathematics, an algebra over a field (often simply called an algebra) is a vector space equipped with a bilinear product. Thus, an algebra is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with operations of multiplication and addition and scalar multiplication by elements of a field and satisfying the axioms implied by "vector space" and "bilinear".*

It sounds, well... quite dry. Since academics tend to favor rigor over an engaging presentation style, that's what most lectures tend to look like. While it works, it isn't the most pleasant experience for the student. After all, psychology 101 says that pressure triggers resistance and resentment. 

Might there be a better way?

What if the professor told you that there's no such thing as a fundamental law of nature that says that energy has to be conserved? Or momentum? Providence isn't sitting there and counting. What happenes is there is a deep connection between symmetries of the law of nature 

What if the professor were to tell you that instead of working with those pesky and highly abstract groups, you could use something called representation theory (which is merely using square matrices to represent group elements) and that all of a sudden, things not only become a lot simpler but these representations can be split into atomic (irreducible) subrepresentations that give us a lot of the stable phenomena that we see, like electron orbitals?

For example, irreducible representations of the SO(3) group, which is just the group of rotations in 3D, give us spherical harmonics.

What if I told you particles aren't really particles? They are quanta, meaning that the energy of fields comes in discreet form (multiples of a base value) but that these quanta are spatially extended and can potentiall exist everywhere in the universe?
