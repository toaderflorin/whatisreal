title:  "Spooking Action At A Distance Is Real"
description: "Whether it's your wife coming home from the mall with yet another bag that she doesn't need, but she bought it *because it was on sale*, a coworker snapping at you because he had a bad day, or a road rage incident that ended in legal repercussions, human behavior shows no shortage of irrationality and I'm sure you've been left scratching your head on more than one occasion...

Quantum spin is quite baffling and hard to understand intuitively - some textbooks describe it as being similar to the property of a spinning top, but that's not accurate. If we take the view that the electron is a classical pointlike particle, the electron will rotate around its axis at speeds far exceeding the speed of light, which is prohibited by relativity. This is not what quantum spin is. In quantum field theory, particles don't even have precise locations but are defined as spatially extended normal modes, which makes it even harder to define spin as a rotation around some axis. However very interestingly, spin is real angular momentum, albeit intrinsic -- if you make a lump of spin-up particles, that lump does spin indeed. But if the particles themselves don't turn on their axis, then what does? It opens up interesting questions about what space is. 

Electrons whizzing through magnetic fields are deflected just like a rotating charged object would be in classical electrodynamics, but there is a caveat. Along any direction, on measurement, we find either clockwise or anticlockwise spinâ€”nothing in between.

The electrons are deflected either up or down, nothing in between. If the spin was measured to be up in a particular direction, then all subsequent measurements in that direction will confirm the previous finding. But what if we turn the measuring apparatus by 90 degrees and make it perpendicular? In that case, we find a 50%-50% probability that the spin is up or down. For intermediate angles, it's a sin/cos ratio [is it]. Again, remeasuring will give the same result, so it's fair to conclude that the measuring process is not gentle; it collapses the spin to a definite value in a specific direction.

Let's look at another situation. Let's imagine a process by which we create a pair of particles, for example, an electron and a positron. We know that the total angular momentum must be zero, and that seems to be the case. But upon measuring a particle at 

Einstein famously hated this and called it spooky action at a distance. His argument was something like this:

*If you have a pair of gloves and you put each glove in a separate box, then upon opening one of the boxes and finding the left-hand glove, you immediately know that the remaining box contains the right-hand glove. So nothing mysterious happens, and there isn't any communication between the particles.*

Let's try to understand correlation mathematically. Let's imagine we have a coin, and every time we get heads, we consider we got a 1 value and for tails -1. Over time, if we average the results, we get 0. But what if we have two coins and want to see if there is any correlation between the results we get by tossing them? Well, we can multiply the values we get and average that. If they are 100% correlated, every time we get a 1 from coin A, we'll get a 1 from coin B, same with -1. Since -1 times -1 equal one and 1 times 1 both equal one, the average is 1. If they are anti-correlated, we get -1. If they aren't correlated, we will get an average of 0. 

In the case of gloves, finding one glove, then the other gives us a 100% correlation, but there's no mysterious reason. The gloves were in the respective boxes the whole time. 

But is that really what's happening? What if we place detectors perpendicular to the direction of the two particles? In that case, we would get a 50-50 percent chance of them being up or down, so they could have the same value. We don't see that happening. 

But what if we get a bit more sophisticated? In 1970, John Bell had an idea: what if the particles have some kind of internal set of instructions that determine how they respond when asked what is your spin in direction X? Partner particles would agree to give exactly opposite answers for each possible direction on creation, and then go on their merry way. We can consider detectors placed at three angles with 120 degrees between them. The two particles would contain instructions on how to respond to each detector, calculate all possible combinations, and compare them to what quantum mechanics predicts. We would then randomly select a detector and calculate correlations.
