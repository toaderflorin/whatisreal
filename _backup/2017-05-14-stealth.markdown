A common misconception is that stealth aircraft are invisible to radar. They are not, they simply have a reduced cross section. Just consider this: you have to be much closer to a coin then you have to be to a mountain in order to see it, so what low observability does is it gives airplanes first hit advantage.

Before we start though, we need to look at the physics of reflection. Radars work by shining a beam of radio electromagnetic energy and detecting the reflection from whatever object happens to be in the way of the beam.

Let’s first examine how different materials reflect light. A wall (for example) reflects light much differently than a mirror or metal.

![image-title-here](/images/reflection1.gif){:class="img-responsive"}  

When light hits a wall, it is basically scattered in all directions, whereas when light hits a mirror, it bounces off at the same angle it came in at. And obviously, there are objects with intermediate roughness, which spread light, but only a little bit. Which means you get something like this:

![image-title-here](/images/reflection.png){:class="img-responsive"}  

Smooth objects reflect back in a small number of directions, whereas rough surfaces reflect back all over the place. The roughness of the object surface determines how shiny or matte the object is. Shiny object appear darker, and they have bright spots where the angle of incoming light bounces off as such that it hits the camera or the eye of the observer, as you can see in this more extreme example.

OK, enough for an introduction. In the case of radars, the emitter of “light” and the observer are the same. A typical radar would send a short pulse of electromagnetic energy (in the radio spectrum) in one direction of space, turn off the transmitter and “listen” for the incoming echo for a certain amount of time, and then rotate it’s antenna dish a little bit and scan in another direction, and so forth (modern aircraft usually use phased arrays to redirect the beam, not moving antennas, but that’s for another article). And here is the principle of stealth: if the object diffuses electromagnetic energy in all directions, there is a good chance that a portion of that will be emitted right back to the radar and be picked up.

Typically, conventional aircraft have a lot of surface features with irregular angles such as antennas, bolts, engine intakes, the blades of the engine fan, the cockpit, missiles mounted on the fuselage etc. and at any point, any one of these features can be perpendicular to the radar way as such that it bounces back to the radar. But it turns out it doesn’t even have to be perpendicular: right angles have the property of reflecting the beam back irrespective of where it came from.

Check it out:

And a lot of things are mounted at right angles on conventional airplanes — say the tail or the missile mounts, the stabiliser fins on missiles etc.
Now let’s check out the B2 Spirit and look at how stealth is achieved.

![image-title-here](/images/b22.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}  

First of all, it has a smooth surface which means that from any observation angle only an infinitesimally small surface portion will be perpendicular to the radar at any moment in time. The ordinance is kept in an internal bay, and the planes also lacks vertical stabilisers. The engine intakes which produce some echo are placed on the top of the airplane so that the B-2 is harder to spot by ground radars. If a ground radar doesn’t pick up an airplane flying at high altitude, no jets will be scrambled into the air to intercept it, so the cross-section when viewed from below is much more important. Now you might have noticed the presence of really jagged edges in portions of the stealth aircraft, such as the exhaust nozzles or the shape of the wings. Before I get into that, a little bit of history.

At some point in history, the nice, tall medieval castles and fortresses changed to… this. Which is a peculiar structure in itself, but also bears an uncanny resemblance to the lines we see on stealth aircraft. So what caused this change? Gunpowder.

With a conventional type of fortress, you can easily have a line of cannons parallel to a wall (which means that they fire perpendicular to the wall and inflict great damage). The jagged angled wall and moat structure makes it much harder for the besieging army to do this. Firing at an odd angle normally just makes the projectile bounce off, especially when this is coupled with a shorter and thicker wall. Also as a side note, in the past, sappers could work at the base of the wall and undermine the structure in relative safety, because they were in the blind spot of shooters on the wall battlements. The star structure allows for different portions of the wall to cover the blind spots of other portions.


![image-title-here](/images/fortress.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}  

You are always going to have surface features on a real aircraft which cannot be smooth (as you can see on this F-35), because you need to put in fuel, access various systems etc., so in this case it’s better to have jagged line to bounce of the incoming signal at various angles. But wouldn’t a radar be able to detect those reflected waves? Sure. But those reflected waves go to the side, and usually an aircraft is either flying towards a target (ingress) or away (egress), so the size of the front and back cross sections are more important than the side cross section.

![image-title-here](/images/f22.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

Check out the parallel lines of the intakes, main and tail wings o the F-22. They are all aligned, and the idea is that you want to limit the number of angles your plane is visible from. The odds of a leading edge to be perpendicular to a radar wave is minimal — the plane would have to be turning and the radar would have to send the pulse at precisely that time minus whatever time the wave needs to get to the airplane. And even if the plane is briefly detected, that just one short bleep on the radar which disappears on the next scan.
