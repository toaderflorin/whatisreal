description: "Philosophy has no shortage of discussions about time. Newton thought space and time are absolute. Leibniz strongly disagreed and concluded that space and time are most likely some kind of network of relationships.

*Surprisingly, space can give you a good understanding of time. You can measure time in meters if you want, but I'm getting slightly ahead of myself.*

There are few things more beautiful than a night sky on a really clear night. The fascinating thing is that when you look at it, you really are looking into the distant past because a lot of the "stars" are actually galaxies and they are millions of light years away.

So essentially what you see looks something like this.

I know I'm going a bit off on a tangent, but I want you to have a look at something. You really need to see an [autopsy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4l1o0SZL6c) to see just how big the human brain is -- and it uses up a lot of glucose to operate. The brain is incredibly efficient at some things (like processing visual expressions of other humans) and really bad at doing basic calculations like taking the square root out of 251 (a computer, by the way, would be the exact opposite). This, by the way, is why you have a hard time understanding quantum mechanics.

Of course, your brain does have an intuition for space (in your frame of reference, anyway) so if you were in a park with alleys laid out in a rectangular fashion and you'd want to get from point A to point B, you would know you can choose not to obey the "don't step on the grass sign" and walk diagonally because it's shorter. You don't need mathematics to figure that out but what Pythagora's theorem is good at is in giving you an exact number for how much shorter that would be.

We of course track multiple object and locations at the same time.

Imagine you have a stick -- if you know where the ends are in some coordinate system, you can calculate the length by summing up the square. We use this grid model and assign coordinates to points which depend on how we choose this coordinate system. But this is arbitrary.

No matter how we rotate the stick or we change the coordinate system, the length stays the same. We learned that in high-school. Minkowski realised that while space depends on observer movement, there is another quantity that is invariant.

The problem is that if you take Lorentz transforms into account, this no longer holds. But if you can't rely on the Euclidean distance, what can you rely on? Minkowski figured it's this.
