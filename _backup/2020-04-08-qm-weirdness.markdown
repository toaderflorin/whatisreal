title:  "Early Signs Of Quantum Weirdness"
description: "In 1905, a young Albert Einstein put out a paper which he called *Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper (On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies)* that would forever change the way we think about space and time and among other things, it says that space contracts, time dilates and even the notion of simultaneity is relative and observer dependent.

Once upon a time there was a physics professor, a class and a pesky student. The professor was 

Sir Isaac Newton is estimated to have had an IQ of 190. And while it's hard to say for sure if it really was precisely that high, you probably need something that high to invent a totally different branch of mathematics - calculus (though it's debatable whether he or Leibnitz were first). One thing is certain: his contributions to humanity are priceless and even if in the meantime Einstein came along and changed our views about space, time and dynamics, even now Newtonian physics is all we need to build a rocket to put people on the Moon or rovers on Mars.

But as influential as Newton's law of dynamics were (good old F = ma), they were problematic in some situations, namely whenever you have a system that has holonomic constraints. If you have a bead sliding down on a wire, or a pendulum that's attached to a ceiling, than the x and y coordinates of the ball are constrained to a semicircle of length L.

So what you can do is assume there's always a tension force in the direction of the wire that always keeps 

Lagrange had this idea that instead of using cartesian coordinates like (x, y), a system like this pendulum can be described in terms of a single coordinate theta and he was able to work out the math. The mathematics aren't simple, but he was able to come up with some laws of dynamics that would work for any coordinates (these are called generalized) not just cartesian coordinates. 

The time evolution of a system is given by the following formula ![em-wave](/images/lagrange.svg){:class="img-responsive"} where

There something strange about light. Most people think it goes in straight lines and it usually does, but put something in its path and it will go around the obstacle, which is strange. Also, if light encounters multiple mediums with different refraction indexes, it will actually bend when going from one medium to another: this happens because light actually takes the path that takes the shortest time. This is called Fermat's principle.

Imagine you have a lifeguard on duty seeing somebody drowning:

There are multiple paths the lifeguard can take to save the victim. He can run directly to the victim (which is the shortest path in terms of distance) but since he can run much much faster than he can swim that's definitely not optimal in terms of time, so what he can try to do is run to point B which minimizes the distance he needs to swim. That's all fine and dandy, but that this isn't optimal in terms of time because in this case the distance is really to long. Turns out there's a middle path C, somewhere in between which minimises time and that's precisely the trajectory that light takes. Now if you're wondering:

How does light know what's the path that takes the shortest time, you've asked the million dollar question. 

But we're really getting ahead of ourselves - the history of physics and mathematics is long and convoluted.


Where the term L is the difference between kinetic and potential energy. A bit more complicated than F = ma for sure, but nonetheless it works for any kind of curved / generalized coordinate systems so this is really nifty. 

But then Hamilton noticed something interesting: he saw that he can deduce Lagrange's formula using a variational principle:

![em-wave](/images/action.svg){:class="img-responsive"}

The path a system takes over time is as such that a certain quantity is minimum. But again one might ask: how does the system know which path has the:

We now know this happens because the world is quantum mechanical in nature.
