Here's a nice picture of our Sun, a big ball of plasmaâ€”quite a far cry from the Platonic image of a perfect sphere, right? But have you wondered what exactly makes it shine and where all that activity is coming from?

OK, I'll make this short and sweet.

The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and helium, so the energy it gives off is nothing more than the result of hydrogen nuclei (which are just protons) fusing together to form helium nuclei (a helium nucleus is made out of two protons and two neutrons). This fusion is the result of the extreme pressure caused by gravitational forces in the core of the Sun, and since it takes four protons to make a *He* nucleus and the masses of those four protons combined are bigger than the mass of a single *He* nucleus, the result is just energy in the form of photons, as per E=mc<sup>2</sup>.

But wait a minute, where do those neutrons come from?

### Enter The Weak Force
As you probably guessed it, a proton can turn into a neutron under the right conditions, but before we see how, let's have a look at the internal structure of protons and neutrons: a proton is made out of two *up quarks* (each with an electric charge of +2/3) and one *down quark* (which has a charge of -1/3), so the total charge is *2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = 1* and a neutron is made out of one up quark and two down quarks, so it's electrically neutral.

Here is another thing worth pointing: neutrons are not stable outside the nucleus. On their own, they decay on average in about 11 minutes and that happens via de weak force, like so:

![decay](/images/decay.png){:class="img-responsive"}

What happens is one of the down quarks in the neutron spontaneously emits a <i>W <sup>-</sup> boson</i>, and so it turns into an up quark. The W then rapidly decays into an electron and an anti-neutrino. This process is called *beta decay*. Cool, but if you checked Wikipedia, you might have seen that the W is *maaaaaasive*, it has about 100 times the mass of the proton so how in the world can a quark emit something so heavy?

*It can, because it's a virtual particle and it doesn't strictly obey energy conservation laws.*

The time-energy formulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that particles can violate energy conservation laws, but the more they do, the less stable the particle is. And since the W is so massive, it has a very short lifetime, and thus a very small range, much smaller than the width of a proton. The proton is just slightly lighter then the neutron, so in the process of this decay, we get an extra electron and an anti-neutrino for things to balance out.

Okay, but this doesn't explain how a proton turns into a neutron, and in fact that shouldn't even be possible because the neutron is heavier. Turns out that in the core of the Sun, under immense gravitational pressures which lead to temperatures of millions of degrees Centigrade, the protons actually have enough kinetic energy that can transform into mass via E=mc<sup>2</sup> to make this reaction possible. So what actually happens is an up quark emits a W+ boson this time (turning into a down quark), which in turn decays into a positron (the electron's anti-particle) and a neutrino. The positron then quickly finds a nearby electron and [annihilates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation) releasing photons in the process, whereas the neutrino (because it only interacts via the weak force, more on that later) just flies off unimpeded.

### That's Not The Whole Story
You might have looked at the flame of a stove and seen that it's blue, whereas the flame of a campfire or match is yellow. Other hot objects are red. A human body emits in infrared etc. The color of emitted light depends on the temperature of the object and the higher the temperature, the higher the wavelength. Judging by the Sun's color, we conclude it's average surface temperature is 5778 K, so not that hot. Also keep in mind that the *proton-to-neutron* transformation process emits high energy gamma rays, not visible light, so where does the light we see come from?

*You might have heard that photons travel for thousands of years from the Sun's core before being able to escape, because they get scattered by electrically charged particles, such as protons and electrons.*

That is *sort of* the case, but it's slightly more complicated than that. What we're dealing with is inelastic scattering, also called *Compton scattering*. The *inelastic* part refers to the fact that the incident and the scattered photons don't have to have the same wave-length.

Essentially, it's not the *same photon*, in fact it doesn't even make sense to talk about particle identity in quantum field theory, because particles are indistinguishable. What we care about is energy and momentum being conserved.

![scattering](/images/scattering.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Think about it this way: the Earth (and our bodies) is being heated by a small relative number of higher energy photons (light) by the Sun, but emits a much larger number of low energy photons (infrared) into space, thus remaining at thermal equilibrium. The same thing happens inside the Sun: a smaller number of very energetic photons (gamma rays) transform into a larger number of visible light photons (the ones that escape the surface of the Sun and we are able to see). Yes, this process takes thousands of years, but we are *not talking about the same photons* that originated in the core of the Sun.

That covers the W boson, but you might have heard there is another particle that mediates the weak force called the *Z boson*. This particle is electrically neutral (so it is its own anti-particle) and it's also very massive, so it too has very a short range as explained by the time-energy uncertainty relationship.

*It carries momentum, energy and spin between weakly charged particles (so you can think of the Z as a chubby photon that also interacts with neutrinos), a phenomenon called [weak neutral current](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/august-2009/weak-neutral-current).*

### CP Violation
Here's an interesting fact about our Universe: only [left-handed](http://florintoader.net/quantum-spin) particles interact with the W and Z bosons, which means that the weak interaction clearly violates [P-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-symmetry) (which says particles should behave the same as their spatial mirror image). Additionally, only left-handed neutrinos (and right-handed anti-neutrinos) have been observed, and if right-handed neutrinos exist, they are thought to be very [massive](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/neutrinos-on-a-seesaw), way beyond the masses that would make them observable at the LHC.

While the weak interaction breaks P-symmetry, it was thought for some time that it obeys CP symmetry (which is [charge conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-symmetry) and P symmetries taken together), for example that *left-handed electrons behave like right-handed positrons, and right-handed electrons behave like left-handed electrons*. But it turns out that's also not true. But to scientists surprise, they found out K and B meson decays violate CP symmetry but only *very slightly*, something like 1 part in 1000. So CP is not a symmetry of nature, but since we know that [CPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPT_symmetry) is, this means that the weak interaction also breaks T-symmetry (because if *a + b = 0* and *a* is not zero, that means *b* must also be non-zero), namely it doesn't look the same if time flows the other way.

All things decay, not just neutrons or massive gauge bosons. Even us...

*Could this be the answer why time seems to be flowing forward and why there is a surplus of matter over anti-matter?*
